## About Client

Billie is a Berlin based, breakthrough fintech startup that aims to upgrade the operating system of B2B payments. 

As an experienced and passionate team we enable businesses to pay and get paid on their own terms.

## Business Model

An invoice is a document issued by a seller (creditor) to the buyer (debtor). It provides details
about a sale or services, including the quantities, costs.

Factoring is a process where a company (creditor) sells its invoice to a third-party factoring
company (Billie). 

The factoring company then takes care of collecting the money from the debtor.
Since there is always the risk that a debtor won't pay their invoices, Billie sets a debtor limit for
each company. This means that Billie won't accept the invoice if the debtor's total amount of open
invoices reaches the limit.
